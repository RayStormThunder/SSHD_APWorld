# Skyward Sword HD - Archipelago APWorld

An [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) multiworld randomizer integration for **The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD**.

## What is this?

This APWorld allows you to play Skyward Sword HD in a multiworld randomizer with other Archipelago-supported games. Items are shuffled across all players in a cooperative experience where finding items in your world may send them to players in completely different games!

## Features

- **800+ Locations**: All chests, goddess cubes, NPCs, dungeons, minigames, and more
- **200+ Items**: Progression items, equipment, tablets, keys, consumables
- **Full Logic Support**: Ensures you always have items needed to progress
- **40+ Options**: Customize starting items, logic difficulty, item placement
- **Custom Logos**: Replace title screen with Archipelago branding

## Download

### Pre-built Release
Download the latest `sshd.apworld`, `Skyward Sword HD.yaml`, `launch_sshd.bat`, and `launch_sshd_wrapper.py` files from the [Releases](https://github.com/LonLon-Labs/SSHD_APWorld/releases) page.

### Build from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LonLon-Labs/SSHD_APWorld.git
cd sshd_apworld
python build_apworld.py
```

## System Requirements
- **Archipelago**: Version 0.5.0 or higher (Tested with 0.6.6)
- **Python**: 3.10 or higher (Tested with Python 3.13.9)
- **Emulator**: Ryujinx (Tested on 1.1.1376)
- **Game**: The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD and Update Data (Switch)

## Quick Start

### 0. Install Python and dependencies

- Install Python 3.10 or higher (MAKE SURE TO ADD IT TO PATH)
- Install the dependencies from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

### 1. Install the APWorld and other files

Place `sshd.apworld` in one of these locations:
- **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Archipelago\custom_worlds\`
- **Linux/Mac**: `~/.local/share/Archipelago/custom_worlds/`

Place `launch_sshd_wrapper.py` in `C:\ProgramData\Archipelago`

Place `launch_sshd.bat` anywhere (or in `C:\ProgramData\Archipelago` - it works from anywhere)

### 2. Extract Your Game

You'll need a legally obtained copy of Skyward Sword HD for Nintendo Switch along with the update data.

1. Extract the RomFS and ExeFS from your game using Ryujinx (MAKE SURE THE UPDATE IS INSTALLED BEFORE EXTRACTING)
2. Extract them to `C:\ProgramData\Archipelago\sshd_extract` under a `romfs` and an `exefs` folder

### 3. Generate Your Seed

1. Download [Skyward Sword HD Randomizer](https://github.com/mint-choc-chip-skyblade/sshd-rando/releases/latest)
2. Open it and verify the extracted files
3. Change all of the options to what you would like and copy the Setting String and Seed
4. Create a YAML file using `Skyward Sword HD.yaml` as a template
5. Generate locally using all player yamls

#### From here you have 3 options
1. Upload the outputed zip to [https://archipelago.randomstuff.cc](https://archipelago.randomstuff.cc) (the official website won't work due to a 64MB file upload limit)
   - IF YOU USE THIS, THE WEBSOCKET URL IS NOT `archipelago.randomstuff.cc`, YOU NEED TO INPUT `ap.randomstuff.cc:PORT` INTO YOUR CLIENT
2. Host locally (requires port forwarding)
3. Unzip the zip and remove the patch file
   - Unzip the generated `.zip` file
   - Copy the `.apsshd` file to another spot
   - Delete it from the unziped folder and rezip
   - Now extract `.apsshd` and copy `romfs` and `exefs` to your Ryujinx mod directory (located at `C:\Users\Your_Username\AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx\sdcard\atmosphere\contents\01002da013484000\Archipelago` on Windows - you will need to create the `Archipelago` folder)
   - You can now delete the patch file and upload the rezipped `.zip` file to [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg)

### 4. Open Ryujinx
Make sure the mod and 1.0.1 update are enabled and open Skyward Sword HD

You should see the custom Archipelago logo - that means it's working

Get into the game far enough to where you can move Link

### 4. Launch the Client
Double click `launch_sshd.bat`

### 5. Play!
Items you find are automatically sent to other players and vice-versa!

> Note: You may need to go through a loading zone in order to see or use a new item

> VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: IF FLEDGE SOFTLOCKS YOU AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE GAME, JUST SKIP HIM AND HIS 2 CHECKS, THEY ARE JUST GREEN RUPEES
> NO, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT
